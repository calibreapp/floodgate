## Using floodgate with Google Chrome

If you wish to reliably limit the bandwidth available to Chrome or Chromium, you can do so by starting Chrome with the `--proxy-server` flag.

1. Start floodgate `./floodgate`
2. Start Chrome:

```
google-chrome-canary --proxy-server="socks://localhost:8000" https://calibreapp.com
```

3. The browser is now using a bandwidth limited connection.


## ü§î FAQs

* Why not use the network limiting feature in Google Chrome? 

Because Chrome has many connection types (h2, h2 with server push, http, longpoll, SSE, etc) and it attempts to limit the connection on a per-tab basis, it is really difficult to reliably limit the connection speed for your site. Floodgate circumvents that by providing a proxy server that limits all traffic that it processes.

* Can I use this with browsers that aren't Chrome?

Yes! Start floodgate and then configure your browser of choice to use a SOCKS5 proxy.
